# SyncOne

**SyncOne** is a modular and extensible application designed to manage SMS communication and processing in real-time. Built with .NET MAUI, it supports seamless operation through background services and a robust architecture.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time SMS Processing**:
  - Background service (`SmsService`) ensures continuous SMS processing even when the app is closed.
  - Retry mechanism for reliable SMS delivery with exponential backoff for failed attempts.

- **Platform-Agnostic Design**:
  - Uses `ISmsService` as an abstraction layer for SMS operations, enabling cross-platform integration.

- **Extensible Architecture**:
  - Modular components like `DatabaseService`, `ApiService`, and `ConfigurationService` promote maintainability and scalability.

- **Intelligent Integration**:
  - Supports Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent SMS-based interactions, such as AI assistants, language translation, and more.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Visual Studio 2022 or later with the MAUI workload.
   - .NET 8.0 SDK or later.
   - Android SDK (API level 21 or higher).

2. **Permissions** (for Android):
   - Add the following permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`:
     ```xml
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
     ```

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Ensure DI setup (e.g., Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection) for services like `ISmsService`.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Telli/SyncOne.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project:**
   - Use Visual Studio or any compatible IDE to open the project.

3. **Configure Dependencies:**
   - Register services in your DI container:
     ```csharp
     services.AddSingleton<ISmsService, AndroidSmsService>();
     services.AddSingleton<DatabaseService>();
     services.AddSingleton<ApiService>();
     services.AddSingleton<ConfigurationService>();
     ```

4. **Build and Run:**
   - Build the project and deploy it to an Android device or emulator.

---

## Usage

### Running the Application
- Start the app to initialize the `SmsService`.
- The background service will handle SMS processing even if the app is minimized or closed.

### Using the UI
- The message list displays incoming and processed messages.
- Use the refresh command to reload messages from the database.
